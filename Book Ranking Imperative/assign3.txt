Assign 3 Due 11:59PM November 4

A publisher is interested in keeping track of the rankings of their books on Amazon. They've asked us to write a program that will go out to Amazon with ISBN numbers, fetch the ranking of the books, and report the following details:

Book title  isbn rank
...					...	 ...
...					...	 ...
...					...	 ...
...					...	 ...
...					...	 ...
...					...	 ...
...					...	 ...

The ISBN numbers may be read from a file.

The report is printed in the order of the ranks, from the highest rank to the lowest.

First implement the code using a sequential solution, where the code goes to Amazon with one ISBN number at a time. Work with a few ISBN numbers (10 or 20) as an example to try out the program. Use a mainstream language for this assignment (Java/C#/Ruby, etc. Check with Venkat if you're in doubt about your language choice).

Then make the code concurrent, using the traditional threading and synchronization approach. Use proper locks to avoid race conditions.

After completing that, explore a third solution that may avoid explicit threads and locks within the same language.

In addition to printing the result, print also the time, in seconds, the solutions take.

Provide a build file to run the program.

For those who make use of reviews, take small steps, start with the sequential solution.
